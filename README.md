## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Object-Oriented Design Patterns
```python
class User:                    # Base user entity with authentication
class BankUser(User):         # Extended banking functionality
class Account:                # Account management and operations
class Transaction:            # Transaction processing and logging
class ATMSystem:              # Main system controller
class SecurityManager:       # Security and fraud detection
class DatabaseManager:       # Data persistence layer
```

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Factory Pattern**: User and account creation
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time notifications
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different account types and fee structures
- **Singleton Pattern**: System configuration and logging
- **Command Pattern**: Transaction processing pipeline

### Core Components
- **Authentication Module**: Secure login and session management
- **Transaction Engine**: High-performance transaction processing
- **Security Layer**: Encryption, validation, and fraud detection
- **Data Persistence**: File-based and database storage options
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive audit trails and monitoring

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.7 or higher
python --version

# Optional: Virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv atm_env
source atm_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: atm_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/josemsantiago/ATM.git
cd ATM

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the ATM simulator
python ATMSimulator.py
```

### Configuration
Create a `config.json` file for system settings:
```json
{
    "session_timeout": 300,
    "max_login_attempts": 3,
    "daily_withdrawal_limit": 1000,
    "supported_currencies": ["USD", "EUR", "GBP"],
    "logging_level": "INFO"
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Basic Operations
```python
# Initialize the ATM system
atm = ATMSystem()

# User registration
user = atm.register_user("John Doe", "1234", "secure_password")

# Login and session management
session = atm.login("John Doe", "1234")

# Perform banking operations
session.check_balance()
session.deposit(500.00)
session.withdraw(100.00)
session.transfer_money("Jane Doe", 50.00)
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Generate account statement
statement = session.generate_statement(days=30)

# Set up account alerts
session.set_alert("balance_below", 100.00)

# Schedule recurring transfers
session.schedule_transfer("Savings", 200.00, "monthly")
```

## üß™ Testing
